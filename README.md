This program is designed to automatically update a dark theme on Windows 10. Usually, after unlocking the system, a custom black theme crashes and you have to re-apply the theme and then turn on the dark theme manually. This program automatically updates the theme after unlocking your User.

Just choose the path to the theme that will be applied automatically, activate the automatic task in the program and the theme will be automatically updated.

You can manually adjust the latency timings for applying the settings.

The program will be updated when bugs are detected.

To use the program, you need to unzip the program and all files from the archive into a specific folder and perform initial setup and activate autorun.
